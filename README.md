## Problem description

In this repository we set out to calculate the the ground state energy of the $BeH_2$ molecule as accurately as possible using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm.

With the presently available Near-term Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware, some of the most common approaches to such problems are the so-called Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE). The key component is the choice of an ansatz (UCCSD, Givens rotations, etc.), with certain approximations, for example:Â 

* Frozen core (orbital removal)
* Simple orbital basis set (sto-3G), which should be increased for more accurate results
  
The goal of these approximations is to reduce the qubit cost. This can also be adressed by tapering the Hamiltonian operator to reduce the search space by making use of any symmetries to a particular molecule. The ground state can then be searched for in a certain symmetry sector.

However, VQE methods are prone to so-called Barren plateaus, which seriously hinder finding the optimum. In addition, the classical optimisation task is often facing high dimensional non-convex playgrounds, which complicate the problem further. The result is also sensitive to the ansatz being used, which often needs to have many parameters in order to be expressive enough. On present-day NISQ devices the latter presents a variety of different challenges on its own.

Due to the issues outlined above people have been searching for alternative methods for finding the ground state energy of molecules, which would lead to better answers. In this repository, we follow the Iterative Quantum Assisted Eigensolver (IQAE) approach described by Bharti and Haug [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05638.pdf].

The IQAE algorithm relies on creating a subspace on which the Hamiltonian will be diagonalised. The idea is to have a subspace small enough to have an advantage over directly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, but also expressive enough to have a good approximation of the ground state. This subspace is built from the Krylov subspace and some initial state, which is taken to be the output of a VQE algorithm. The goal is to start from this optimized state and further improve the estimation of the ground state energy.
